% A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE PROGRAM OR FUNCTION DOES
% Calculates the cost, area, and perimeter of water reservoir
% for a given mass and depth, based on the maximum area and perimeter
% for the given site, and the prices listed in a file.

function resData = ReservoirCalc(resDepth, waterMass, maxArea,...
                                 maxPerimeter, wallCostFile, clearCost)
    
    % Calculate the area needed to store waterMass at a depth of resDepth
    resArea = waterMass / (1000 * resDepth);
    
    % Calculate the perimeter required to store said water, scaled from
    % maxPerimeter and maxArea
    perimeter = maxPerimeter * sqrt(resArea / maxArea);
    
    % Load the wall pricings from wallCostFile
    depthCosts = load(wallCostFile);
    
    % Find the entry for the current reservoir depth and calculate costs
    numDepths = length(depthCosts);
    for i = 1:numDepths
        if (abs(resDepth - depthCosts(i, 1)) < 0.001)
            cost = perimeter * depthCosts(i, 2) + resArea * clearCost;
        end
    end
    
    % Return results
    resData = [cost, resArea, perimeter];
